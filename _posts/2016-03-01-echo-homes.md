Renewable homes not just for the rich thanks to a new indigenous firm in Nigeria. **KINGS DALE MULTI-RESOURCES LTD**

is a rapidly growing multi-strategy renewable energy integrated real estate advisory & property development firm actively pioneering the provision of environmentally friendly property solutions in the mass housing & commercial services arena. The firm is driven by the goal to provide homes for the low-mid income families and individuals that are affordable, functional, aesthetically and environmentally compatible.

They are running a scheme called Home Ownership Made Easy (H.O.M.E). The**"H.O.M.E" **is an affordable housing scheme designed to offer low-mid income earners/civil servants & their loved ones an integrated turnkey approach to effortlessly owning beautiful, functional, qualitative and ecologically compliant buildings consistent with their personal & family aspirations. The "H.O.M.E" scheme is focused on Abuja and the **package **is borne out of the need to proffer a housing solution that addresses the social and economic realities of owning a home in the Federal Capital Territory given the near unbearable building costs and breakneck interest on mortgage loans. The company is also looking at other states to offer the same scheme

They work with individuals seeking a home or potential investors who share the same vision. They deploy a simple formula when evaluating partners to work with by selecting potential projects that merge technological innovation, flexibility and a strong global outlook in business operations.
