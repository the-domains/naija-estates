Urban planning in Nigeria has been a piece meal approach, city wide planning is seldom and at National level there seem to be no appetite to prepare plans or guidelines for urban planning in the country. The planning legislation in Nigeria is very robust (Decree No. 12 of 1992) and needs plans and guidelines to implement the legislation.

Urban planning profession in the country often depend on foreign case studies. A book recently published by a former president of the Nigerian Institute of Town Planners titled 'Perspective on Urban and Regional Planning in Nigeria (collection of papers and speeches)' aims to strengthen the town planning profession in the country.

The Author of the book Mr Olubunmi Ajayi said that some of the major areas his book focused on included housing, rural development, regional planning, physical planning, urban governance, environmental issues and planning practice. He said the academia would find historical information and ideas to aid their understanding as well as research and reduce their dependence on foreign materials and authors.

Ajayi said, "Honestly, I don't really want to indict the Nigerian academia. I have attended more than 30 inaugural lectures and what I find is that everybody is trying to quote foreign authors. One third of the inaugural lectures are bibliography and this is rubbish. Why can't we have our own experience documented so that other people can now make reference to it? And that is why I made up my mind that my experiences, which I have collected over the years, must be in a book form.

According to him, his book "is more like something indigenous, something that will be relevant, something that Nigerian professionals will read and get benefit from rather than just cramming, copying things that will not work here. This is one of the reasons why a lot of planning endeavours don't work here because they do not relate to our situation. So, since this is from the Nigerian experience, it can be useful to Nigerians."

"For your planning to be meaningful, you must understand the culture of your people, you must understand the socio-economic circumstance of your people. Look at Abuja, it was designed without consideration for public transportation, and that is why the design is not compact. Where are the bus stops in Abuja? They are just coming now after almost 20 years. The railway is just being considered."

The former NITP boss advised planners to strive to understand the culture of the people as well as their socio-economic circumstance so as to come up with functional plans.

He said, "We should not blame the government alone for not patronising the local professionals. We can also blame ourselves, the professionals for this. This is because a lot of us do not even know how to explain things to government.

"We are too engrossed with our technical language, which many of those in government do not understand. We assume they do, but the reality is that they do not, except for now when we have some professionals going into politics."
