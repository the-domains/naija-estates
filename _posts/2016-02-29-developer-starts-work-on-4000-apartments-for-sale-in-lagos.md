The Lagos State Government, in partnership with an indigenous developer, FirstWorld Communities, has commenced the construction of a 4,000-unit housing estate to be known as CHOIS City, it has been gathered.

According to the, Punch the estate, which already has over 600 completed units, is located at Agbowa, and planned as a mixed development consisting of two and three-bedroom flats. The estate is designed to reduce the deficit of houses in the state and comes with infrastructure such as network of roads and other amenities.

The Business Development Manager, FirstWorld Communities, Mr. Ayodele Yussuf, said CHOIS was an acronym for Co-Operative Homes Ownership Incentive Scheme, an initiative of the Public-Private Partnership agreement between the Lagos State Government and the firm to deliver 10,000 homes for low and medium income earners.

He added that the state government and the company embarked on the initiative so as to bridge the affordability gap between the cost of housing and people's income. According to him, the site is a strategic location both to the metropolis and to the lagoon, adding that those who worked in Lagos metropolis would find the location an ideal place in terms of its serenity and closeness to the seat of government.

He said, "We are introducing a 'lease to buy' under the Cooperative Home Ownership Incentive Scheme Club. Club members will be able to take possession of a property once 50 per cent equity contribution is made over a period of three to five years. Other benefits are low interest rate, long term repayment period to ease cash flow, buying from a government scheme, and reduced infrastructural facilities cost through economy of scale.

"The development has easy access to Lagos Island via Epe. It is 15 minutes to Ikorodu and under an hour to Lekki by car; 40 minutes to Victoria Island through ferry; and on completion of proposals for waterway transport services on the lagoon, virtually every part of Lagos will be accessible within one hour by ferry."
